The pw_crack takes in a file with common passwords and a file of hashes for
passwords it then finds the MD5 and Blowfish hashes for each line attempting
to find the password that was used. The process then prints out the given 
hashes with passwords if one was found or with out if none was found.

To run this program a person need to have a file named bcrypt with a bcrypt.a
inside this way it can access the needed functions for the blowfish hashing.

NOTE: if the user wished to have the bcrypt .a not inside of a file they will
need to change the makefile to say bcrypt.a instead of bcrypt/bcrypt.a as well
in the pw_crack.c the import bcrypt/bcrypt.a will need to have the bcrypt/ 
removed

To compile the program the user just needs to enter make into the command line

To run the program the user need to have the executable followed by a valid
file containing the common passwords then a valid file with the hash values

Ex. pw_crack passwords.txt hashvalues.txt the function will then run to
completion.

Note: There was a weird bug where the process would segfault when run however
when run in gdb debugger would not segfault ever. This issue appears solved
in the event of a segfault please try running the program a couple more times
in the event the error arises again.
