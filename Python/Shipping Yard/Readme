This Project is a simple program to maintain a simple shipping yard.
The Shipping yard begins empty then as packages are added the program
sorts the packages into containers set to a common destination.
Inside each container the packages are sorted so that the heviest packages are
at the bottom of the container and become lighter at the top. Each container is able
to hold a total of 2000 in weight.
It is all based on text in the command line. Load the two .py files into
a single file and load in a python environment.

After loading the program to run the command Main() will begin the program.
You can then use the given commands(ex. a) to add, remove ship packages and containers

Commands:
  a = add a package in the order of Sender Destination Weight (ex. Steve Toronto 1500)
  s = search for package in the order of PackageID Destination (ex. 100000 Montreal)
  p = Prints the containers and packages(
    md = manifest only for a given destination with the container being first then the packages in assending weights)
    ma = prints information on all the containers and packages in them for the entire yard
    cc = prints information for all containers in the yard)
  r = remove a package in the order of PackageId Destination (ex. 100000 Montreal)
  sh = Shipout containers for a destination in the order of Destination(ex.Toronto)
  rc = read a container file into the shipping yard (a TestContainerFile.txt is provided, file must have .txt or such on end)
  ra = reads a list of packages from a file into the shipping yard (TestPackageFile is provided file must have .txt or such on end)
  w = writes a container file to a given exisiting file(file name must exist and entry must have .txt or such)
