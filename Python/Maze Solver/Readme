This program needs to have both MazeSolver.py and MazeSolverClass.py
in the same file. Then use an IDE or python to compile the MazeSolver.py
project. 

After doing so type the command solver() into the command window,
It should then ask for the name of the Maze you wish to solve.

You can either type the name of a maze provided or hit enter without
typing anything which will load maze1020. 

If the maze files are not located in the same file as the MazeSolver.py
you must enter the entire path to the maze file. 
For example if the Maze is located in a file called Mazes
and the file is maze510 you must enter Mazes/maze510
